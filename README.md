# [Customer Insight]

This is a personal project where I use the RFM model and correlation to understand customer behavior and define customer segments. The tools used for this project are Power BI and Python.
- Data was taken from kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/georgerocha/ifooddataadvancedanalyticstest)
- I used the RFM model, a marketing analysis tool, to identify or segment clients based on the nature of their spending habits. The RFM model evaluates customers by scoring them in three categories and predicts which customers are likely to purchase the product again.
- I also used correlation to analyze whether income affects purchasing behavior or not.
